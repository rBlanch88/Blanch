<li> I believe that the purpose if the graphics on this website are to get the users attention to sell their product. </li>
<li> The website I selected meets the guidelines very well. 
A guideline it fits especially well is making sure that the contrast between text on top of graphics is good enough that you can read the text 
and still make out what the graphic is of. </li>
<li> A guideline that it fails to meet is to provide a textual equivalent alternative for grahic content. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="filetypes"> Graphic File Types </h2>
<ul>
<li> The best file format for image 1 would be to use a GIF file.
It's best to use this format since the image only has four colors and has a very basic and easy layout. </li>
<li> The best file format for image 2 would be to use JPEG because it allows up to 16 million different colors. 
It works well with image 2 since its a picture of a monkey that has many different colors. </li>
<li> The best file format for image 3 would  be PNG.
Image 3 best fits PNG because it has many different colors especially between the split between the mountain and the sky. </li>
<li> The best file format for image 4 is a GIF file.
A GIF file would best fit image 4 because it is a very simple picture with only four different colors. </li>
<li> The best file format for image 5 would be the Native file formats.
This is the best choice for image 5 because it has four layers
 the white background, grey border, solid red on the inside, and then stop in white on top of the red.
Each layer can be easily edited using photoshop which with knowing that made me pick the native file format. </li>
</ul>
